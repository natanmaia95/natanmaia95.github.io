## About the Project

Movement FPS is a prototype for a first-person-shooter game with advanced movement, inspired by games like Ghostrunner, Titanfall and Severed Steel.

It's a collaborative project between me, on the programming side, and Daniel "Guarah" Feitosa in charge of the design side.

#### Features

- Responsive FPS controls and movement physics
- Movement tech like slides, wallrunning, and grappling
- Score system that rewards combos of movement tricks and kills

## Development Tools

The game was made in Godot 4.3. Blender was used to tweak the level models.
The placeholder gun models are sourced from Kenney.

<!-- ## Development Process

The project idea started when my boyfriend said his post-it notes kept falling from the wardrobe he stuck them on. 
He didn't want to buy a whiteboard yet so he thought of making the notes in digital form, and I ran with that idea.
His task tracker system to help with ADHD is similar to a Kanban board, but also features some notes for rewards, which are drafted
after each task is completed.

I started the project on a weekend after coming home from a party, by Sunday I had notes working, and by Monday the timer and save systems were working too.
I may have overworked myself but it felt really fun and a nice change of pace from the projects I was doing before.

I also posted WIP videos on my Bluesky account. -->
